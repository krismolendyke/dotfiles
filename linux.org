* Display Manager

  GDM3 and Gnome 3 is stock on the Dell XPS 13 7390.  They are
  occasionally convenient but I don't want GDM to start by default.
  Console login is good.

  Disable GDM at boot, use console login

         #modifiers: None

     # Mouse bindings
     #
     # Mouse bindings are specified as a list of objects, much like the key
     # bindings further below.
     #
     # To trigger mouse bindings when an application running within Alacritty captures the mouse, the
     # `Shift` modifier is automatically added as a requirement.
     #
     # Each mouse binding will specify a:
     #
     # - `mouse`:
     #
     #   - Middle
     #   - Left
     #   - Right
     #   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
     #
     # - `action` (see key bindings)
     #
     # And optionally:
     #
     # - `mods` (see key bindings)
     #mouse_bindings:
     #  - { mouse: Middle, action: PasteSelection }

     # Key bindings
     #
     # Key bindings are specified as a list of objects. For example, this is the
     # default paste binding:
     #
     # `- { key: V, mods: Control|Shift, action: Paste }`
     #
     # Each key binding will specify a:
     #
     # - `key`: Identifier of the key pressed
     #
     #    - A-Z
     #    - F1-F24
     #    - Key0-Key9
     #
     #    A full list with available key codes can be found here:
     #    https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/event/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
     #
     #    Instead of using the name of the keys, the `key` field also supports using
     #    the scancode of the desired key. Scancodes have to be specified as a
     #    decimal number. This command will allow you to display the hex scancodes
     #    for certain keys:
     #
     #       `showkey --scancodes`.
     #
     # Then exactly one of:
     #
     # - `chars`: Send a byte sequence to the running application
     #
     #    The `chars` field writes the specified string to the terminal. This makes
     #    it possible to pass escape sequences. To find escape codes for bindings
     #    like `PageUp` (`"\x1b[5~"`), you can run the command `showkey -a` outside
     #    of tmux. Note that applications use terminfo to map escape sequences back
     #    to keys. It is therefore required to update the terminfo when changing an
     #    escape sequence.
     #
     # - `action`: Execute a predefined action
     #
     #   - Copy
     #   - Paste
     #   - PasteSelection
     #   - IncreaseFontSize
     #   - DecreaseFontSize
     #   - ResetFontSize
     #   - ScrollPageUp
     #   - ScrollPageDown
     #   - ScrollLineUp
     #   - ScrollLineDown
     #   - ScrollToTop
     #   - ScrollToBottom
     #   - ClearHistory
     #   - Hide
     #   - Minimize
     #   - Quit
     #   - ToggleFullscreen
     #   - SpawnNewInstance
     #   - ClearLogNotice
     #   - ReceiveChar
     #   - None
     #
     #   (macOS only):
     #   - ToggleSimpleFullscreen: Enters fullscreen without occupying another space
     #
     # - `command`: Fork and execute a specified command plus arguments
     #
     #    The `command` field must be a map containing a `program` string and an
     #    `args` array of command line parameter strings. For example:
     #       `{ program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] }`
     #
     # And optionally:
     #
     # - `mods`: Key modifiers to filter binding actions
     #
     #    - Command
     #    - Control
     #    - Option
     #    - Super
     #    - Shift
     #    - Alt
     #
     #    Multiple `mods` can be combined using `|` like this:
     #       `mods: Control|Shift`.
     #    Whitespace and capitalization are relevant and must match the example.
     #
     # - `mode`: Indicate a binding for only specific terminal reported modes
     #
     #    This is mainly used to send applications the correct escape sequences
     #    when in different modes.
     #
     #    - AppCursor
     #    - AppKeypad
     #    - Alt
     #
     #    A `~` operator can be used before a mode to apply the binding whenever
     #    the mode is *not* active, e.g. `~Alt`.
     #
     # Bindings are always filled by default, but will be replaced when a new
     # binding with the same triggers is defined. To unset a default binding, it can
     # be mapped to the `ReceiveChar` action. Alternatively, you can use `None` for
     # a no-op if you do not wish to receive input characters for that binding.
     #
     # If the same trigger is assigned to multiple actions, all of them are executed
     # at once.
     #key_bindings:
       # (Windows, Linux, and BSD only)
